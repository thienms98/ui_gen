# UI Generator

This app allows you to create a quick nextjs page based on TailwindUI (or something else). By simply clicking on a specified component to select or arrange it. Finally, you just need to generate to output Next.js source code

But, the app only generate only one page. So if you find a better solution you can make a PR to help me build it
